        <p> Carl Stone:  <br>
            <br>
            Carl owns a large dairy farm. He is moderately wealthy and has access to the latest
            in technological innovations. He has several employees to help run his farm. 
            He is always looking for ways to increase productivity. He knows that health of
            the livestock directly correlates to milk production.
            He wants to know ahead of time what the weather will be so he can ensure the health and well being of his livestock.

            <p> Wayne McCallister: <br> <br>
            Wayne runs a small farm with a variety of crops. He inherited his family farm and his sons help him
            run it. His livelyhood is tied to the productivity of his potatoes. He doesn't have
            much money to invest in new techniques, so he is looking for things he can do to 
            keep productivity high without spending a fortune. He would like to know if he can expect
            an early frost or a prolonged summer drought.
