                <p class='first'>The Apia Samoa Temple was announced October 15th, 1977. 
                    The Apia Samoa Temple was the first temple built in Samoa and the third built in Polynesia, 
                    following the Laie Hawaii Temple (1919) and the Hamilton New Zealand Temple (1958). <br><br>
                    On the evening of July 9, 2003—nearly 20 years after its dedication—the Apia Samoa Temple 
                    was destroyed by fire while closed for an extensive remodeling project. One week later, 
                    President Gordon B. Hinckley announced that the temple would be rebuilt.
                    On January 25, 2005, the same angel Moroni statue that had survived the fire 
                    that engulfed the original building was placed atop the newly rebuilt Apia Samoa Temple.
                    The Apia Samoa Temple was rededicated on September 4, 2005. 
                    The Apia Samoa Temple was the second temple to be completely destroyed and rebuilt.
                    (The other is the Nauvoo Temple.)
